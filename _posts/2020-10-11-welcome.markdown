## Welcome to my blog!

Finally, after so many years, I have decided to take _the_ dive, I am writing my blog.

At first, I will blog about technical stuff that I have been gathering for years of programming in so many languages I have lost the count.

As I am a beginner with [Jekyll][jekyll], the excellent blog generator, you can expect the layout to evolve at least in the first few weeks or months as I (hopefully) become less clumsy with it.
